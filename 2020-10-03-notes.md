#### First I blew up my input image
* My input image was `400x1130` 

* I printed the `400x1130` image with my printer , at `100%` scale and used a ruler to measure it at `2.375" X 6.625"` 
* Based on my work surface being about a `12" by 48"` canvas, I figured `5x` would be suitable
* That would produce `2000x5650` or `12" by 33.125"`

* So I used _ImageMagick_ `convert` ..
```
$ convert dragon1.png -resize 2000x5650 dragon1_5x.png
```

#### My first attempt
* Based on my measurements above, and since my printer paper is the typical `8.5" x 11"`, I started using _ImageMagick_ `crop` , 

```
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+0+0 dragon1_5x_crop__11.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+1000+0 dragon1_5x_crop__12.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+1000+1883 dragon1_5x_crop__22.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+0+1883 dragon1_5x_crop__21.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+0+3766 dragon1_5x_crop__31.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1883+1000+3766 dragon1_5x_crop__32.png
```
* For my output images, I would just attempt to print them and observe the scaling the printing software was doing
* It was performing a `82%` scaling, so I did some further reduction, as below, (and I observed `100%` scaling by my printing software, or no scaling that is, so I kept going with that )
```
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1412+0+0 dragon1_5x_crop__11_of_4x2.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1412+1000+0 dragon1_5x_crop__12_of_4x2.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1412+0+1412 dragon1_5x_crop__21_of_4x2.png
$ convert dragon1_5x.png -crop 1000x1412+1000+1412 dragon1_5x_crop__22_of_4x2.png
```
